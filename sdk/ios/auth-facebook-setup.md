# Set Up Facebook Authentication

To use the following Facebook service configuration steps to federate Facebook as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, try the AWS Amplify [User Sign-in feature](./add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in).

You must first register your application with Facebook by using the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).

AWS Amplify generates code that enables you to use Facebook to provide federated authentication for your mobile app users. This topic explains how to set up Facebook as an identity provider for your app.

If you already have a Facebook app ID, copy and paste it into the `Facebook App ID` field
when configuring authentication using the AWS Amplify CLI.

**To get a Facebook app ID**

1. In the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/), sign in with your
   Facebook credentials.

2. From `Create App`, choose `Add a New App` (note: this menu label will be
   `My Apps` if you have previously created an app.

   setup`.

4. Type a display name for your app, select a category for your app from the `Category`
   drop-down list, and then choose `Create App ID`.

9. In the Facebook Developers portal, choose `Save changes`, then `Use this
   package name` if a dialog appears saying that Google Play has an issue with your package name.

10. Only users with roles assigned in the Facebook portal will be able to authenticate through your
   app while it is in development (not yet published).

    To authorize users, in the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose
    `Roles`, then `Add Testers`. Provide a valid Facebook ID.
