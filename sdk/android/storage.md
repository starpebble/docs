# Storage

## S3

### Overview

Enable your app to store and retrieve user files from cloud storage with the permissions model that suits your purpose. The CLI deploys and configures cloud storage buckets using [Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/).

### Storage Access

The CLI configures three different access levels on the storage bucket: public, protected and private. When you run `amplify add storage`, the CLI will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using a Cognito Identity Pool Role. You will have the option of adding CRUD (Create/Update, Read and Delete) based permissions as well, so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted limited permissions within these levels.

If you had previously enabled user sign-in by running `amplify add auth` in your project, the policies will be connected to an `Authenticated Role` of the Identity Pool which has scoped permission to the objects in the bucket for each user identity. If you haven't configured user sign-in, then an `Unauthenticated Role` will be assigned for each unique user/device combination, which still has scoped permissions to just their objects.

* Public: Accessible by all users of your app. Files are stored under the `public/` path in your S3 bucket.
* Protected: Readable by all users, but writable only by the creating user. Files are stored under `protected/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.
* Private: Only accessible for the individual user. Files are stored under `private/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

See [Authentication](./authentication) for more information on how to get the `user_identity_id` for a signed in user.
### Set Up Your Backend

1. Complete the [Get Started](start) steps before you proceed.

2. Use the CLI to add storage to your cloud-enabled backend and app.

    In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that typically contains your project level build.gradle), and add the SDK to your app.

    ```bash
    $ cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
    $ amplify add storage
    ```
3. Choose `Content` as your storage service.

    `‚ùØ Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`

4. The combination of friendly name and bucket name must be globally unique. If another S3 user has specified the same values for both of these as you, the amplify push step below will fail.

5. The CLI walks you through the options to enable Auth (if not enabled previously), to name your S3 bucket, and to decide who should have access (select `Auth and guest users` and toggle all to select `create/update, read, and delete` access for both auth and guest users).

6. Confirm that you have Storage and Auth set up.

    ```bash
      $ amplify status
      | Category  | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
      | --------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
      | Auth      | cognito2e202b09 | Create    | awscloudformation |
      | Storage   | sabc0123de      | Create    | awscloudformation |
      ```
7. To create your backend run:

    ```bash
    $ amplify push
    ```

    The CLI will create the awsconfiguration.json file in your project's `res/raw` directory.

##### Lambda Triggers
If you want to enable triggers for the storage category with Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB as providers, the CLI supports associating Lambda triggers with S3 and DynamoDB events. For example, this can be useful for a use case where you want to invoke a Lambda function after a create or update operation on a DynamoDB table managed by the Amplify CLI. [Read More]({%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.docs_baseurl}}{%endif%}/cli-toolchain/quickstart#storage-examples)

### Connect to Your Backend

Use the following steps to connect add file storage backend services to your app.

1. Add the following to `app/build.gradle` (Module:app):

	```groovy
	dependencies {
	  implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-s3:2.15.+'
	  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }
	  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-userpools:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }
	}
	```
	Perform a `Gradle Sync` to download the AWS Mobile SDK components into your app.

2. Add the following to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

	```xml
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
	<service android:name="com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.s3.transferutility.TransferService" android:enabled="true" />
	```

### Mocking and Local Testing

Amplify supports running a local mock server for testing your application with S3. Please see the [CLI Toolchain documentation](../cli-toolchain/usage#mocking-and-testing) for more details.

## Using TransferUtility 

To make it easy to upload and download objects from Amazon S3, we provide a TransferUtility component with built-in support for background transfers, progress tracking, and MultiPart uploads. The Transfer Utility component set includes a Service called the TransferService, which monitors network connectivity changes. When the device goes offline, the TransferService will pause all ongoing transfers; when the device is back online, the Transfer Service will resume paused transfers.


Starting with version 2.7.0, the `TransferService` will not be automatically started or stopped by `TransferUtility`. You have to start `TransferService` manually from your application. A recommended way is to start the service upon Application startup, by including the following line in the `onCreate` method of your app's Application class.

```java
getApplicationContext().startService(new Intent(getApplicationContext(), TransferService.class));
```

This section explains how to implement upload and download functionality and a number of additional storage use cases.

Note: If you use the transfer utility MultiPart upload feature, take advantage of automatic cleanup features by setting up the [AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html) action in your Amazon S3 bucket life cycle configuration.

### Upload a File

The following example shows how to use the TransferUtility to upload a file. Instantiate the TransferUtility object using the provided TransferUtility builder function. Use the `AWSMobileClient` to get the `AWSConfiguration` and `AWSCredentialsProvider` to pass into the builder. See [Authentication](authentication) for more details.  

The TransferUtility checks the size of the file being uploaded and automatically switches over to using multi-part uploads if the file size exceeds 5 MB.

        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        getApplicationContext().startService(new Intent(getApplicationContext(), TransferService.class));

        // Initialize the AWSMobileClient if not initialized
        AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {

                Log.i(TAG, "AWSMobileClient initialized. User State is " + userStateDetails.getUserState());
                uploadWithTransferUtility();
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Exception e) {
                Log.e(TAG, "Initialization error.", e);
            }
        });

    }

    public void uploadWithTransferUtility() {

        TransferUtility transferUtility =
                TransferUtility.builder()
                        .context(getApplicationContext())
                        .awsConfiguration(AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getConfiguration())
                        .s3Client(new AmazonS3Client(AWSMobileClient.getInstance()))
                        .build();

        File file = new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir(), "sample.txt");
        try {
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));
            writer.append("Howdy World!");
            writer.close();
        }
        catch(Exception e) {

        }

        TransferObserver uploadObserver =
                transferUtility.upload(
                        "public/sample.txt",
                        new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir(),"sample.txt"));

        // Attach a listener to the observer to get state update and progress notifications
        uploadObserver.setTransferListener(new TransferListener() {

            @Override
            public void onStateChanged(int id, TransferState state) {
                if (TransferState.COMPLETED == state) {
                    // Handle a completed upload.
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void onProgressChanged(int id, long bytesCurrent, long bytesTotal) {
                float percentDonef = ((float) bytesCurrent / (float) bytesTotal) * 100;
                int percentDone = (int)percentDonef;

                Log.d(TAG, "ID:" + id + " bytesCurrent: " + bytesCurrent
                        + " bytesTotal: " + bytesTotal + " " + percentDone + "%");
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(int id, Exception ex) {
                // Handle errors
            }

        });

        // If you prefer to poll for the data, instead of attaching a
        // listener, check for the state and progress in the observer.
        if (TransferState.COMPLETED == uploadObserver.getState()) {
            // Handle a completed upload.
        }

        Log.d(TAG, "Bytes Transferred: " + uploadObserver.getBytesTransferred());
        Log.d(TAG, "Bytes Total: " + uploadObserver.getBytesTotal());
    }
}
```

If you run this code, login to your AWS console, and go to the S3 service, you'll see a bucket and file structure like this (in this example the friendly name specified was `dev` and the bucket name was `storagedemo`):

                // Handle errors
            }

        });

        // If you prefer to poll for the data, instead of attaching a
        // listener, check for the state and progress in the observer.
        if (TransferState.COMPLETED == downloadObserver.getState()) {

        }

        Log.d("Your Activity", "Bytes Transferred: " + downloadObserver.getBytesTransferred());
        Log.d("Your Activity", "Bytes Total: " + downloadObserver.getBytesTotal());
    }
}
```

### Track Transfer Progress


With the TransferUtility, the `download` and `upload` methods return a `TransferObserver` object. This object gives access to:

1.  The transfer state, as an `enum`
2.  The total bytes that have been transferred so far
3.  The total bytes remaining to transfer
4.  A unique ID that you can use to keep track of each transfer

Given the transfer ID, the `TransferObserver` object can be retrieved from anywhere in your app, even if the app was terminated during a transfer. It also lets you create a `TransferListener`, which will be updated on changes to transfer state, progress, and when an error occurs.

To get the progress of a transfer, call `setTransferListener()` on your `TransferObserver`. This requires you to implement `onStateChanged`, `onProgressChanged`, and `onError` as shown in the example.  

```java

TransferObserver transferObserver = download(MY_BUCKET, OBJECT_KEY, MY_FILE);
transferObserver.setTransferListener(new TransferListener(){

    @Override
    public void onStateChanged(int id, TransferState state) {
        // do something
    }

    @Override
    public void onProgressChanged(int id, long bytesCurrent, long bytesTotal) {
        int percentage = (int) (bytesCurrent/bytesTotal * 100);
        //Display percentage transferred to user
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(int id, Exception ex) {
        // do something
    }
});
```

The transfer ID can be retrieved from the `TransferObserver` object that is returned from the upload or download function.  You can also query for `TransferObservers` using the `getTransfersWithType(transferType)` or the `getTransfersWithTypeAndState(transferType, transferState)` method.

```java
// Gets id of the transfer.
int transferId = transferObserver.getId();
```

### Pause a Transfer


Transfers can be paused using the `pause(transferId)` method. If your app is terminated, crashes, or loses Internet connectivity, transfers are automatically paused.

To pause a single transfer:
```java
transferUtility.pause(idOfTransferToBePaused);
```

To pause all uploads:

```java
transferUtility.pauseAllWithType(TransferType.UPLOAD);
```

To pause all downloads:

```java
transferUtility.pauseAllWithType(TransferType.DOWNLOAD);
```

To pause all transfers of any type:

```java
transferUtility.pauseAllWithType(TransferType.ANY);
```

### Resume a Transfer


In the case of a loss in network connectivity, transfers will automatically resume when network connectivity is restored. If the app crashed or was terminated by the operating system, transfers can be resumed with the `resume(transferId)` method.


To resume a single transfer:

```java
transferUtility.resume(idOfTransferToBeResumed);
```
To resume all uploads:

```java
transferUtility.resumeAllWithType(TransferType.UPLOAD);
```

To resume all downloads:

```java
transferUtility.resumeAllWithType(TransferType.DOWNLOAD);
```

To resume all transfers of any type:

```java
transferUtility.resumeAllWithType(TransferType.ANY);
```

### Cancel a Transfer

To cancel an upload, call cancel() or cancelAllWithType() on the `TransferUtility` object.

To cancel a single transfer, use:

```java

transferUtility.cancel(idToBeCancelled);
```

To cancel all transfers of a certain type, use:

```java

transferUtility.cancelAllWithType(TransferType.DOWNLOAD);
```

### Background Transfers

The SDK uploads and downloads objects from Amazon S3 using background threads. These transfers will continue to run regardless of whether your app is running in the foreground or background.

### Long-running Transfers 

When you want your app to perform long-running transfers in the background, you can initiate the transfers from a background service that you can implement within your app. A recommended way to use a service to initiate the transfer is demonstrated in the [Transfer Utility sample application](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-android-samples/tree/master/S3TransferUtilitySample).

### Supporting TransferService on Oreo and above

`TransferNetworkLossHandler`, a broadcast receiver that listens for network connectivity changes is introduced in `2.11.0`. `TransferNetworkLossHandler` pauses the on-going transfers when the network goes offline and resumes the transfers that were paused when the network comes back online. `TransferService` registers the `TransferNetworkLossHandler` when the service is created and de-registers the handler when the service is destroyed.

* `TransferService` will be moved to the foreground state when the device is running Android Oreo (API Level 26) and above. 
  * Transitioning to the foreground state requires a valid on-going `Notification` object, identifier for on-going notification and the flag that determines the ability to remove the on-going notification when the service transitions out of foreground state. If a valid notification object is not passed in, the service will not be transitioned into the foreground state.
  * The `TransferService` can now be started using `startForegroundService` method to move the service to foreground state. The service can be invoked in the following way to transition the service to foreground state.
 
```java
Intent tsIntent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), TransferService.class);
tsIntent.putExtra(TransferService.INTENT_KEY_NOTIFICATION, <notification-object>);
tsIntent.putExtra(TransferService.INTENT_KEY_NOTIFICATION_ID, <notification-id>);
tsIntent.putExtra(TransferService.INTENT_KEY_REMOVE_NOTIFICATION, <remove-notification-when-service-stops-foreground>);
getApplicationContext().startForegroundService(tsIntent);
```

### Supporting Unicode characters in key-names

**Upload/download objects**

* Since `2.4.0` version of the SDK, the key name containing characters that require special handling are URL encoded and escaped `( space, %2A, ~, /, :, ', (, ), !, [, ] )` by the `AmazonS3Client`, after which the AWS Android Core Runtime encodes the URL resulting in double encoding of the key name.

* Starting `2.11.0`, the additional layer of encoding and escaping done by `AmazonS3Client` is removed. The key name will not be encoded and escaped by `AmazonS3Client`. Now, the key name that is given to `AmazonS3Client` or `TransferUtility` will appear on the Amazon S3 console as is.

**List Objects**
  
* When a S3 bucket contains objects with key names containing characters that require special handling, and since the SDK has an XML parser,  (XML 1.0 parser) which cannot parse some characters, the SDK is required to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. This can be done by passing in `url` as `encodingType` in the `ListObjectsRequest`.

```java
AmazonS3Client s3 = new AmazonS3Client(credentials);
final ObjectListing objectListing = s3.listObjects(
                new ListObjectsRequest(bucketName, prefix, null, null, null)
                    .withEncodingType(Constants.URL_ENCODING));
```
 
* Since `2.4.0`, there was a bug where the SDK did not decode the key names which are encoded by S3 when `url` is requested as the `encodingType`. This is fixed in `2.11.0`, where the SDK will decode the key names in the `ListObjectsResponse` sent by S3.

* If you have objects in S3 bucket that has a key name containing characters that require special handling, you need to pass the `encodingType` as `url` in the `ListObjectsRequest`.


### Transfer with Object Metadata


To upload a file with metadata, use the `ObjectMetadata` object. Create a `ObjectMetadata` object and add in the metadata headers and pass it to the upload function.

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ObjectMetadata;

ObjectMetadata myObjectMetadata = new ObjectMetadata();

//create a map to store user metadata
Map<String, String> userMetadata = new HashMap<String,String>();
userMetadata.put("myKey","myVal");

//call setUserMetadata on our ObjectMetadata object, passing it our map
myObjectMetadata.setUserMetadata(userMetadata);
```

Then, upload an object along with its metadata:

```java

TransferObserver observer = transferUtility.upload(
  MY_BUCKET,        /* The bucket to upload to */
  OBJECT_KEY,       /* The key for the uploaded object */
  MY_FILE,          /* The file where the data to upload exists */
  myObjectMetadata  /* The ObjectMetadata associated with the object*/
);
```

To download the metadata, use the S3 `getObjectMetadata` method. See the [API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSAndroidSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.html#getObjectMetadata%28com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.GetObjectMetadataRequest%29) and [Object Key and Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html) for more information.

### Transfer Utility Options

You can use the `TransferUtilityOptions` object to customize the operations of the TransferUtility.

#### TransferThreadPoolSize
This parameter allows you to specify the number of transfers that can run in parallel. By increasing the number of threads, you will be able to increase the number of parts of a multi-part upload that will be uploaded in parallel. By default, this is set to 2 * (N + 1), where N is the number of available processors on the mobile device. The minimum allowed value is 2.

```java
TransferUtilityOptions options = new TransferUtilityOptions();
options.setTransferThreadPoolSize(8);

TransferUtility transferUtility = TransferUtility.builder()
    // Pass-in S3Client, Context, AWSConfiguration/DefaultBucket Name
    .transferUtilityOptions(options)
    .build();
```

#### TransferNetworkConnectionType
The `TransferNetworkConnectionType` option allows you to restrict the type of network connection (WiFi / Mobile / ANY) over which the data can be transferred to Amazon S3.

```java
TransferUtilityOptions options = new TransferUtilityOptions(10, TransferNetworkConnectionType.WIFI);

TransferUtility transferUtility = TransferUtility.builder()
    // Pass-in S3Client, Context, AWSConfiguration/DefaultBucket Name
    .transferUtilityOptions(options)
    .build();
```

By specifying `TransferNetworkConnectionType.WIFI` , data transfers to and from S3 will only happen when the device is on a WiFi connection

## Usage with GraphQL APIs (Complex Objects)
Note: Please review the documentation for [API](./api) before you proceed with the rest of this section. 
{: .callout .callout--info}

You can also upload and download Amazon S3 Objects using AWS AppSync, a GraphQL based solution to build data-driven apps with real-time and offline capabilities. Sometimes you might want to create logical objects that have more complex data, such as images or videos, as part of their structure.  _For example, you might create a Person type with a profile picture or a Post type that has an associated image_. You can use AWS AppSync to model these as GraphQL types. If any of your mutations have a variable with bucket, key, region, mimeType, and localUri fields, the SDK uploads the file to Amazon S3 for you.

Attach the following policy to your IAM role to grant it programmatic read-write access to your bucket:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::myBucket"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::myBucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schema Setup
If any mutations have an input type `S3ObjectInput` with fields `bucket`, `key`, `region`, `mimeType` and `localUri` fields, the SDK will upload the file to S3.
```
  input S3ObjectInput {
    bucket: String!
    key: String!
    region: String!
    localUri: String
    mimeType: String
  }
```
For example, to add a photo field in the ``Post`` type. Update ``Post`` type, add the new ``S3ObjectInput`` type and add a new mutation, ``putPostWithPhoto``.
```
  type Mutation {
      ...other mutations here...
      putPostWithPhoto(
          id: ID!,
          author: String!,
          title: String,
          content: String,
          url: String,
          ups: Int,
          downs: Int,
          photo: S3ObjectInput
          version: Int!
      ): Post
  }
  type S3Object {
       bucket: String!
       key: String!
       region: String!
  }
  input S3ObjectInput {
       bucket: String!
       key: String!
       region: String!
       localUri: String
       mimeType: String
  }
  type Post {
      id: ID!
      author: String!
      title: String
      content: String
      url: String
      ups: Int
      downs: Int
      photo: S3Object
      version: Int!
  }
```
Next, update the putPostWithPhoto mutation resolver to use ``PutItemWithS3Object`` template for request mapping
and ``Return single item`` for response mapping from the AppSync console.
Next, update the response mapping template for the ``photo`` field.
```
$util.toJson($util.dynamodb.fromS3ObjectJson($context.source.file))
```
### Client Code
To use complex objects, you need AWS Identity and Access Management credentials for reading and writing to Amazon S3.
These can be separate from the other authentication credentials used in the AWS AppSync client.
Credentials for complex objects are set in the `S3ObjectManagerImplementation` builder parameter, which you can use like the following:
```java
public class ClientFactory {
    // ...other code...
    private static volatile AWSAppSyncClient client;
    private static volatile S3ObjectManagerImplementation s3ObjectManager;
    public static AWSAppSyncClient getInstance(Context context) {
      if (client == null) {
        client = AWSAppSyncClient.builder()
                .context(context)
                .awsConfiguration(new AWSConfiguration(context))
                .s3ObjectManager(getS3ObjectManager(context)) // Here we initialize the s3 object manager.
                .build();
      }
      return client;
    }
    // Copy the below two methods and add the .s3ObjectManager builder parameter
    // initialize and fetch the S3 Client
    public static final S3ObjectManagerImplementation getS3ObjectManager(final Context context) {
      if (s3ObjectManager == null) {
          AmazonS3Client s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(getCredentialsProvider(context));
          s3Client.setRegion(Region.getRegion("us-east-1")); // you can set the region of bucket here
          s3ObjectManager = new S3ObjectManagerImplementation(s3Client);
      }
      return s3ObjectManager;
    }
    // initialize and fetch cognito credentials provider for S3 Object Manager
    public static final AWSCredentialsProvider getCredentialsProvider(final Context context){
    final CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider credentialsProvider = new CognitoCachingCredentialsProvider(
            context,
            Constants.COGNITO_IDENTITY, // Identity pool ID
            Regions.fromName(Constants.COGNITO_REGION) // Region
            );
      return credentialsProvider;
    }
}
```
The SDK uploads the file found at the ``localUri`` when the bucket, key, region, localUri, and mimeType are all provided.
Now, the SDK uploads any field which has ``S3ObjectInput`` type in the mutation. The only requirement from a developer is to provide the correct bucket, key, region, localUri, and mimeType.
Example:
Add the following permissions to ``AndroidManifest.xml``:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```
Then, in your activity where you are adding a post, update the code as follows:
```java
public class AddPostActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    // ...other code...
    // Photo selector application code.
    private static int RESULT_LOAD_IMAGE = 1;
    private String photoPath;
    public void choosePhoto() {
        Intent i = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_PICK, android.provider.MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI);
        startActivityForResult(i, RESULT_LOAD_IMAGE);
    }
    @Override
    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if (requestCode == RESULT_LOAD_IMAGE && resultCode == RESULT_OK && null != data) {
            Uri selectedImage = data.getData();
            String[] filePathColumn = {MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA};
            Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(selectedImage,
                    filePathColumn, null, null, null);
            cursor.moveToFirst();
            int columnIndex = cursor.getColumnIndex(filePathColumn[0]);
            String picturePath = cursor.getString(columnIndex);
            cursor.close();
            // String picturePath contains the path of selected Image
            photoPath = picturePath;
        }
    }
    // Actual mutation code
    private void save() {
        final String title = ((EditText) findViewById(R.id.updateTitle)).getText().toString();
        final String author = ((EditText) findViewById(R.id.updateAuthor)).getText().toString();
        final String url = ((EditText) findViewById(R.id.updateUrl)).getText().toString();
        final String content = ((EditText) findViewById(R.id.updateContent)).getText().toString();
        S3ObjectInput s3ObjectInput = S3ObjectInput.builder()
            .bucket("YOUR_BUCKET_NAME")
            .key("public/"+ UUID.randomUUID().toString())
            .region("us-east-1")
            .localUri(photoPath)
            .mimeType("image/jpg").build();
        PutPostWithPhotoMutation addPostMutation = PutPostWithPhotoMutation.builder()
                .title(title)
                .author(author)
                .url(url)
                .content(content)
                .ups(0)
                .downs(0)
                .photo(s3ObjectInput)
                .expectedVersion(1)
                .build();
        ClientFactory.getInstance(this).mutate(addPostMutation).enqueue(postsCallback);
    }
    // Mutation callback code
    private GraphQLCall.Callback<PutPostWithPhotoMutation.Data> postsCallback = new GraphQLCall.Callback<PutPostWithPhotoMutation.Data>() {
        @Override
        public void onResponse(@Nonnull final Response<PutPostWithPhotoMutation.Data> response) {
            runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    Toast.makeText(AddPostActivity.this, "Added post", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    AddPostActivity.this.finish();
                }
            });
        }
        @Override
        public void onFailure(@Nonnull final ApolloException e) {
            runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    Log.e("", "Failed to perform AddPostMutation", e);
                    Toast.makeText(AddPostActivity.this, "Failed to add post", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    AddPostActivity.this.finish();
                }
            });
        }
    };
}
```


## Note on Transfer Utility and AWS Cognito


If you expect your app to perform transfers that take longer than 50 minutes, use [AmazonS3Client](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSAndroidSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Client.html) instead of [TransferUtility](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSAndroidSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/mobileconnectors/s3/transferutility/TransferUtility.html).
