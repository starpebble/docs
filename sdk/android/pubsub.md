# PubSub

PubSub provides connectivity with cloud-based message-oriented middleware. You can use PubSub to pass messages between your app instances and your app's backend creating real-time interactive experiences.

PubSub is available with **AWS IoT**. 

When using AWS IoT your PubSub HTTP requests are automatically signed when sending your messages.

## Installation and Configuration

### AWS IoT

In the PubSub category, `AWSIoTMqttManager` establishes a signed connection with AWS IoT according to [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html). 

Set up AWS Mobile SDK components by including the following libraries in your `app/build.gradle` dependencies list.

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-iot:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }
  implementation ('com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:2.15.+@aar') { transitive = true }
}
```

* `aws-android-sdk-iot` library enables connecting to AWS IoT.
* `aws-android-sdk-mobile-client` library gives access to the AWS credentials provider and configurations.

To use in your app, import the following classes:

```java
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.iot.AWSIotMqttManager;
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.iot.AWSIotMqttNewMessageCallback;
import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.iot.AWSIotMqttQos;
```

Define your unique client ID and endpoint (incl. region) in your configuration:

```java
// Initialize the AWSIotMqttManager with the configuration
AWSIotMqttManager mqttManager = new AWSIotMqttManager(
	"<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", 
	"xxxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.<YOUR-AWS-REGION>.amazonaws.com");
```
You can get the endpoint information from the IoT Core -> Settings page on the AWS Console.

**Create IAM policies for AWS IoT**

To use PubSub with AWS IoT, you will need to create the necessary IAM policies in the AWS IoT Console, and attach them to your Amazon Cognito Identity. 

Go to IoT Core and choose *Secure* from the left navigation pane. Then navigate to *Create Policy*. The following `myIOTPolicy` policy will allow full access to all the topics.

![Alt text]({%if jekyll.environment == 'production'%}{{site.amplify.docs_baseurl}}{%endif%}/js/images/iot_attach_policy.png?raw=true "Title")


**Attach your policy to your Amazon Cognito Identity**

To attach the policy to your *Cognito Identity*, begin by retrieving the `Cognito Identity Id` from `AWSMobileClient`.

```java
AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getIdentityId();
```

Then, you need to attach the `myIOTPolicy` policy to the user's *Cognito Identity Id* with the following [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) command:

```bash
aws iot attach-principal-policy --policy-name 'myIOTPolicy' --principal '<YOUR_COGNITO_IDENTITY_ID>'
```

To programmatically attach the `myIOTPolicy` policy to the user's *Cognito Identity Id*, import the following classes:

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.iot.AWSIotClient;
import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;
import com.amazonaws.services.iot.model.AttachPolicyRequest;
```

Next, instantiate the `AttachPolicyRequest` class and attach it your IoT Client as follows:

```java
AttachPolicyRequest attachPolicyReq = new AttachPolicyRequest();
attachPolicyReq.setPolicyName("myIOTPolicy"); // name of your IOT AWS policy
attachPolicyReq.setTarget(AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getIdentityId());
AWSIotClient mIotAndroidClient = new AWSIotClient(AWSMobileClient.getInstance());
mIotAndroidClient.setRegion(Region.getRegion("<YOUR-AWS-REGION>")); // name of your IoT Region such as "us-east-1"
mIotAndroidClient.attachPolicy(attachPolicyReq);
```

## Working with the API

### Establish Connection

#### Certificate based mutual authentication

To connect with the AWS IoT Core service on the standard MQTT port 8883, you can use the `connect` API as shown below.

```java
mqttManager.connect(<YOUR_KEYSTORE>, new AWSIotMqttClientStatusCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onStatusChanged(final AWSIotMqttClientStatus status,
                                final Throwable throwable) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "Status = " + String.valueOf(status));
    }
});
```

The AWS IoT Core service also allows you to connect devices using MQTT with certificate based mutual authentication on port 443. You can do this using the `connectUsingALPN` API as shown below. See [MQTT with TLS client authentication on port 443](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/mqtt-with-tls-client-authentication-on-port-443-why-it-is-useful-and-how-it-works/) for more information.

```java
mqttManager.connectUsingALPN(<YOUR_KEYSTORE>, new AWSIotMqttClientStatusCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onStatusChanged(final AWSIotMqttClientStatus status,
                                final Throwable throwable) {
        Log.d(LOG_TAG, "Status = " + String.valueOf(status));
    }
});
```

You can take a look at the [API Reference](https://aws-amplify.github.io/aws-sdk-ios/docs/reference/Classes/AWSIoTDataManager.html#//api/name/connectWithClientId:cleanSession:certificateId:statusCallback:
) to get more information.

#### AWS Credentials based Authentication

This method uses AWS Signature Version 4 Credentials to sign the request to connect to the AWS IoT endpoint.

```java
try {
    mqttManager.connect(AWSMobileClient.getInstance(), new AWSIotMqttClientStatusCallback() {
        @Override
        public void onStatusChanged(final AWSIotMqttClientStatus status, final Throwable throwable) {
            Log.d(LOG_TAG, "Connection Status: " + String.valueOf(status));
        }
    });
} catch (final Exception e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Connection error: ", e);
}
```

### Subscribe to a topic

In order to start receiving messages from your provider, you need to subscribe to a topic as follows;

```java
try {
	mqttManager.subscribeToTopic("myTopic", AWSIotMqttQos.QOS0 /* Quality of Service */,
	    new AWSIotMqttNewMessageCallback() {
	        @Override
	        public void onMessageArrived(final String topic, final byte[] data) {
	        	try {
                    String message = new String(data, "UTF-8");
                    Log.d(LOG_TAG, "Message received: " + message);
                } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
                    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Message encoding error: ", e);
                }
	        }
	    });
} catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Subscription error: ", e);
}
```

### Subscribe to multiple topics

To subscribe for multiple topics, just call `subscribeToTopic()` for each topic you wish to subscribe. 

### Publish to a topic

To send a message to a topic, use `publishString()` method with your topic name and the message:

```java
try {
    mqttManager.publishString("Hello to all subscribers!", "myTopic", AWSIotMqttQos.QOS0);
} catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Publish error: ", e);
}
```

### Unsubscribe from a topic

To stop receiving messages from a topic, you can use `unsubscribeTopic()` method:

```java
try {
    mqttManager.unsubscribeTopic("myTopic");
} catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Unsubscription error: ", e);
}

// You will no longer get messages for "myTopic"
```

### Close Connection

In order to disconnect, you need to close the connection as follows:

```java
try {
    mqttManager.disconnect();
} catch (Exception e) {
    Log.e(LOG_TAG, "Disconnect error: ", e);
}
```
